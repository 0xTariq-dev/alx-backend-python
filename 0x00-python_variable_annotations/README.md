# Python Variable Annotations roject

## Description
In this project we will learn about Python Variable Annotations
Python Variable Annotations are a way to declare the type of a variable in Python. This is done by adding a colon after the variable name and then the type of the variable.
For example, if you want to declare a variable called `x` that is an integer, you would write `x: int`.
Variable annotations are not enforced by Python, but they can be used by type checkers to catch errors in your code.
